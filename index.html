      <p class="description">
        The Joke Generator is a beginner-friendly web application designed to entertain users by delivering random, witty jokes at the click of a button. It connects to the icanhazdadjoke API, a public RESTful service that provides a collection of family-friendly “dad jokes.” This project was built using only HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to handle the logic and API interaction. It demonstrates how simple front-end technologies can be used to fetch and display real-time data from external sources. Whether you're learning how APIs work or just in need of a quick laugh, this small app is a fun and practical way to understand the power of JavaScript and asynchronous programming in a real-world scenario.
